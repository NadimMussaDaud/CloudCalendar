# Office Calendar - Cloud-based Calendar Management System

## Overview
This project, **Office Calendar**, is a cloud-based calendar management system implemented in Java. The system allows users within a company to schedule and manage events through a calendar interface. The application includes support for different account types (staff, manager, and guest), as well as handling invitations, event priorities, and conflicts in scheduling. The project was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming course.

## Features
- **Account Management**: Support for staff, manager, and guest accounts with varying levels of permissions.
- **Event Scheduling**: Allows users to schedule events, invite participants, and manage their calendar.
- **Priority Levels**: Events can be set to mid or high priority, with specific rules for handling conflicts and automatic acceptance.
- **Invitation Management**: Users can invite others to events and respond to invitations.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic conflict resolution for overlapping events, especially for high-priority meetings.
- **Command-line Interface**: All interactions with the system are carried out through a command-line interface.

## Project Structure
- **Java Implementation**: The project uses Java, adhering to object-oriented programming principles.
- **Classes and Methods**: The main classes handle user accounts, event creation, invitation management, and event conflict resolution. Methods are written to ensure clean code and efficiency in handling commands.
- **LocalDateTime**: Date and time handling is managed using the `LocalDateTime` class for accurate scheduling.


## How to Use
The application operates via a command-line interface. Here are some of the core commands:
- **`register [email] [type]`**: Register a new account (staff, manager, or guest).
- **`create [email] [event_name] [priority] [date_time] [topics]`**: Create a new event.
- **`invite [invitee_email] [promoter_email] [event_name]`**: Invite a user to an event.
- **`events [email]`**: List all events for a specific account.

For more detailed command usage, refer to the documentation in the project.

## Example
Here's an example of how to create an event and invite users:

```bash
register john.doe@example.com staff
create john.doe@example.com "Team Meeting" mid 2024-08-18 15:00 planning strategy
invite jane.smith@example.com john.doe@example.com "Team Meeting"
```

## Future Enhancements
- **Web-based Interface**: Plan to extend the system with a web-based user interface for more user-friendly interaction.
- **Notifications**: Adding email notifications for invitations and event reminders.
- **Integration**: Integration with existing calendar services like Google Calendar.
